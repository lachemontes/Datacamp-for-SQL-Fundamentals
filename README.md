# Datacamp-for-SQL-Fundamentals
Introduction to SQL
This repository contains my work and notes from the Introduction to SQL course on DataCamp. The course covers the fundamentals of SQL, including database best practices, crafting SQL queries, and understanding popular SQL variants like PostgreSQL and SQL Server.
By the end of this course, I will have hands-on experience in extracting, organizing, and manipulating data from relational databasesâ€”skills essential for data analysis and database management.
